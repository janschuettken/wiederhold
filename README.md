**Bootstrap 4 Support**
Now UI Kit is built on top of the much awaited Bootstrap 4. This makes starting a new project very simple. It also provides benefits if you are already working on a Bootstrap 4 project; you can just import the Now UI Kit style over it. Most of the elements have been redesigned; but if you are using an element we have not touched, it will fall back to the Bootstrap default.

**Example Pages**
We wanted to fully display the power of this kit, so the kit comes packed with examples showing you how to use the components. Inside the product you will find:
